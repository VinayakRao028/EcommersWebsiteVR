d that you want me to convert the file located at `ecommerce_website_vr_001/src/pages/Shop.tsx` to TypeScript using React. However, the current file content is not provided in your message. Without the actual code to convert, I cannot perform the conversion task.

To proceed with the conversion, I would need the content of the `Shop.tsx` file. Once you provide the file content, I'll be able to analyze it, convert it to TypeScript while maintaining React compatibility, and ensure it follows the provided coding standards.

Could you please provide the content of the `Shop.tsx` file? Once I have that, I'll be able to perform the conversion and provide you with the converted TypeScript code
