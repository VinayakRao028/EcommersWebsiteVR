## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js and npm (for frontend development)
- A modern web browser with WebVR support (for VR features)

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd EcommersWebsiteVR_6f8d9e2a/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd EcommersWebsiteVR_6f8d9e2a/frontend
   ```

2. Install the required npm packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

### Starting the Backend Server

1. Ensure you're in the backend directory and your virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```

   The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Accessing the Frontend

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the `frontend/src/index.html` file.

2. For a more robust setup, consider using a local server like Live Server in Visual Studio Code to serve the frontend files.

## 📚 API Documentation

Our backend API is documented using Swagger. To access the Swagger UI and explore the API endpoints:

1. Ensure the backend server is running.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui`.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, its structure, and how to set it up and run it. It uses emojis to make the document more visually appealing and easier to scan. The installation and setup instructions are detailed and cover both the frontend and backend components.

A few notes on assumptions and potential improvements:

1. The backend setup assumes a Flask application. If a different framework is used, these instructions should be adjusted accordingly.

2. The frontend setup assumes the use of npm, which might not be necessary if it's purely HTML/CSS/JS without a build process. This section can be simplified if npm isn't used.

3. The API documentation section assumes Swagger is set up. If it's not, this section should be removed or modified.

4. The license section is left as a placeholder. The development team should insert the appropriate license information or remove this section if not applicable.

5. The VR features are mentioned but not detailed, as the current file structure doesn't show explicit VR-related files. This should be expanded once VR features are implemented.

6. The contributing section is fairly generic and could be customized further based on the team's specific workflow and requirements.

This README should provide a solid foundation for documenting the project. It can be easily updated and expanded as the project evolves and more specific details become available.
