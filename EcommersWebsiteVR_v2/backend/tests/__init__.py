# This file is intentionally left almost empty to mark the directory as a Python package.
# It allows test discovery to work correctly.

# If needed in the future, we could add imports here to make test modules easily accessible, like:
# from .test_product_model import TestProductModel
# from .test_product_routes import TestProductRoutes
# from .test_product_service import TestProductService
